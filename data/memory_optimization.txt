Memory optimization aims to reduce the footprint of models and intermediate tensors during training or inference. Large models can exceed available RAM, causing slowdowns or failures. Techniques such as tensor reuse, in-place operations, and careful data type selection help minimize memory consumption while maintaining performance.
During inference, avoiding unnecessary copies and using contiguous memory layouts can improve both memory usage and speed. Developers often analyze memory allocation patterns using profilers to identify peaks and leaks. Optimizing data pipelines—such as loading and preprocessing steps—also plays a role in reducing overall memory pressure.
In production systems, memory optimization enables deployment on resource-constrained hardware and allows more models or requests to run concurrently. Combining memory reduction with other techniques like quantization or pruning can yield significant efficiency gains. Continuous monitoring ensures that optimizations remain effective as models and workloads evolve.
