An inference pipeline encompasses all steps required to generate predictions from a trained model in production. This includes data preprocessing, model loading, batching, inference execution, and post-processing of outputs. Designing an efficient pipeline ensures low latency, high throughput, and reliable performance under real-world conditions.
Key considerations include model serialization format, hardware configuration, and request handling strategy. Techniques like batching, caching, and asynchronous processing can improve efficiency. Monitoring tools track metrics such as latency, throughput, and error rates to ensure service reliability.
A well-designed inference pipeline integrates profiling and optimization at each stage. From preprocessing to final output, every component contributes to overall performance. Continuous evaluation and iteration help maintain efficiency as models evolve and deployment requirements change.
