The transformer architecture is a deep learning model designed for sequence processing using self-attention mechanisms instead of recurrent or convolutional structures. Its core components include multi-head self-attention, feed-forward neural networks, positional encoding, and residual connections with layer normalization. Self-attention allows each token in a sequence to attend to every other token, enabling strong contextual understanding and parallel computation.
In practice, transformers consist of stacked encoder or decoder layers. Each layer applies multi-head attention to capture relationships across tokens, followed by position-wise feed-forward networks to refine representations. Positional encodings are added to token embeddings to preserve sequence order, which the attention mechanism itself does not inherently capture. This architecture has become foundational for NLP, vision transformers, and multimodal models.
Transformers scale effectively with data and compute, but they are resource-intensive. Their quadratic attention complexity can lead to high memory and latency costs for long sequences. As a result, many optimization techniques—such as efficient attention variants, pruning, and quantization—are applied to make them suitable for real-time or resource-constrained deployments. Despite these challenges, transformers remain the dominant architecture for modern deep learning tasks.
