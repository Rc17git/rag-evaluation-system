Batching is a key technique for improving throughput by processing multiple inputs simultaneously. In CPU inference scenarios, batching can increase hardware utilization and reduce per-sample overhead. However, it introduces a trade-off between latency and throughput: larger batches improve overall efficiency but may increase response time for individual requests.
Latency behavior depends on factors such as batch size, model complexity, and hardware constraints. Small batch sizes often yield lower per-request latency but underutilize compute resources, while larger batches maximize throughput but can cause queueing delays. Profiling across batch sizes helps determine the optimal balance for a given application, especially in real-time systems where latency budgets are strict.
An effective batching strategy involves dynamic or micro-batching, where requests are grouped within short time windows to maintain responsiveness. Monitoring metrics like average latency, tail latency (p95/p99), and throughput ensures that batching decisions align with service-level objectives. Proper batching configuration can significantly improve deployment efficiency without major architectural changes.
