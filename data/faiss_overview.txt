FAISS (Facebook AI Similarity Search) is a library for efficient similarity search and clustering of dense vectors. It is commonly used in applications like semantic search, recommendation systems, and retrieval-augmented generation. FAISS supports large-scale vector indexing and provides both CPU and GPU implementations for high-performance nearest-neighbor search.
The library offers multiple indexing methods, including flat indexes for exact search and approximate methods like IVF, HNSW, and PQ for faster retrieval with reduced memory usage. Choosing the right index depends on dataset size, latency requirements, and accuracy constraints. FAISS also supports vector compression techniques that reduce storage costs while maintaining search quality.
In modern ML pipelines, FAISS is often integrated with embedding models to enable fast retrieval from large corpora. Proper index tuning and benchmarking ensure optimal performance. By combining efficient indexing with scalable search, FAISS enables real-time retrieval even in systems with millions or billions of vectors.
